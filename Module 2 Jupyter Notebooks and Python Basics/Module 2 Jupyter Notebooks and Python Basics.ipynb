It's a great way to organize code, show off figures and include text descriptions of what each chunk of code is doing. In my research group we use these to prepare for lab meetings. If you look back at <b>[Module 1](https://github.com/JakeCanfield8/PSL_475L_Capstone_Physiology_Lab_MSU/blob/master/Module%201%20Hello%20World/Module%201%20Hello%20World.ipynb)</b>, <b>Jupyter Notebooks</b> can also be <b>pushed</b> to our <b>GitHub</b> page online so that other people can view our work! This is especially important because the field of data science is a very collaborative community and thrives best when we share our work with each other."
