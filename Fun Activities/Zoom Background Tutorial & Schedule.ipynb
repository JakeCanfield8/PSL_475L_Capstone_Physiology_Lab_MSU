    "Hey PSL 475 Gang! This semester is going to be super awesome and we are looking for some fun ways to get to know more about you! The 475 teaching team as a broad spectrum of fun personalities including sports fans and movie enthusiasts (especially Star Wars and Lord of the Rings). Each week we are going to select an interesting category or topic that you can use as a chance to express yourself with via your Zoom background when you attend class! Here we will quickly go over how to do change your background. It's really easy and opens up a world of possibility once you get the hang of it!"

Look for <b> Add virtual background image</b> when hovering over it (as shown in the image below).  <b>Note:</b> you can only have a couple of different backgrounds stored on your Zoom account at a time so don't panic if some of the backgrounds from previous weeks are replaced by new ones you add.\n",

    "9. Your background should now be set to your desired image! If you have an older laptop it may require you to check the box that says <b>I have a green screen</b>, even if you don't have one. Ideally this box should be unchecked unless you actually have a green screen. If you have to leave it checked that is fine but your background may have a hard time rendering your face. This shouldn't be a problem if you are using a fairly new mobile device. Once you have the background uploaded, it should be shared across all of your devices if you are logged into the same Zoom account. My camera is not very good AND my laptop is a little older so this feature doesn't work super great for me but this is largely due to my webcam quality. \n",
